# LibraryMS

The Library Management System is a Java-based software application designed to simplify and automate the daily operations of a library. It provides tools for librarians and members to manage books, track borrow/return activities, and handle member accounts efficiently. Built using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, the system ensures modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how core Java and database integration can be used to develop a professional-grade application. It showcases the implementation of key OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction, along with a real-world use case for JDBC to interact with a relational database.
